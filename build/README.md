# Azure Pipelines Build Definitions

EventFly is built in azure pipelines. A description of each of the build pipeline definitions can be found below.

**azure-pipelines-development-ci-cd.yaml** - Runs the pipeline for development builds that go into an internal feed. Packages are alpha.

**azure-pipelines-master-ci-cd.yaml** - Runs the pipeline for development builds that go into an internal feed. Packages are prerelease.

**azure-pipelines-release-ci-cd.yaml** - Runs the pipeline for production builds that go to NuGet. Packages are public and 'production ready'.

**azure-pipelines-static-ci** - Runs a smaller build pipeline used for gating pull requests into both master and dev. no artefacts come from this build.

# FAKE Build Scripts

Right now the shell scripts are under development.

The point of these build scripts is to enable cross plat testing scenarios. Run the following to get the Fake builder to work:

`fake build`
`fake run build.fsx --target Build` 

This assumes that you have fake installed, and that you have followeded [these](http://fake.build/fake-commandline.html) steps. If not then run the shell or command scripts.

# Environment Secrets

INTERNAL_FEED_PAT is the environment secret that holds the azure dev ops personal access token. This access token needs rights to manage the azure dev ops artifacts resource

NUGET_FEED_PAT is the standard NuGet API Key, it too, requires the rights to add new packages

SONARCLOUD_TOKEN is the toke that sonarscanner uses to upload results to https://sonarcloud.io
